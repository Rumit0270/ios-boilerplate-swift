# iOS Boilerplate Setup.
This is a boilerplate project for iOS applications in swift. The code is heavily inspired from this [**repo**](https://github.com/rootstrap/ios-base) by **Rootstrap**
with my own personal touch. I have added some useful extensions and a demo working of how to communicate between entities. This repo is useful for anyone who is 
new to iOS and want to have a initial simple but solid project structure.

## Features
This template comes with:
#### Main
- **API service** class to easily communicate with **REST services**.
- Handy **helpers** and **extensions** to make your coding experience faster and easier.
